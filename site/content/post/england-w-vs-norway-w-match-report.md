Jill Scott scored the opener for England on the third minute, a lovely tucked finish into the bottom corner after the ball came in from Lucy Bronze on the wing, Ellen White leaving it to give Scott the opportunity.

## Scott became only the second ever player to score in three Womens' World Cup competitions.

Nikita Parris's curled effort towards the top right corner blazed over the bar in one of the best opportunities of the first half.

Top scorer Ellen White had a beautiful volleyed effort across the box hit the woodwork in the 28th minute, not able to get England the second goal that they wanted.

There was a close call from Norway for a VAR check after a shot bounced of of the England player's leg and up to their arm. In a competition that has been dominated by refereeing controversy, the officials let this one slide.

Record Goalscorer White tapped in another from close range and became joint top scorer in the competition, this time Parris doing the right thing and sliding the ball across the six yard box towards White who easily finished.

Norway started the second half on the strong foot, working the ball well into the penalty area to an unmarked Hansen. However, Steph Houghton managed to get back to save England.

**Lucy Bronze scored an absolutely brilliant strike at the start of the second half,** the ball was played out to her from a free kick out wide and she managed to smash it home into the top of the net from outside of the box - **what a hit!**

Once again, Norway were one on one with Karen Bardsley, the striker rounded the keeper, but defender Steph Houghton was there as always to keep the clean sheet.

England's first substitution of the night brought on PFA Young Player of the Year Georgia Stanway, replacing a Fran Kirby who had looked better than in previous games, although she may have picked up a slight knock.

**England were gifted a penalty** when Houghton went down during Stanway's free kick. Parris struck high and to the left, but the penalty was stopped by the Norway keeper. She was then substituted off near to the end of the game to be replaced by Rachel Daly.

## **The Lionnesses ultimately cruised through this quarter final tie, and will face either the USA or France in Lyon for the Semi Final. **
